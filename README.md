SSP Course Project Group 7


File : sampler.m: This is the main script for the second paper's implementation. It defines the 3 parts of the algorithm, source motion, sampling possible source positions and updating the weights for the sampled source position using SSP\_EM function on the convolution of the RIR and STFT of the observed speech signal. Then it plots the KDE contour plots for each time step.
